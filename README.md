# üõ°Ô∏è Subsidy Fraud Detection System

## üìã Project Overview

The Subsidy Fraud Detection System is a comprehensive machine learning application designed to identify fraudulent activities in government subsidy programs. Built with Streamlit, this system combines multiple analytical approaches to provide robust fraud detection capabilities for financial institutions and government agencies.

## üéØ Project Context & Problem Statement

### The Challenge

Government subsidy programs are vulnerable to fraudulent activities that can result in significant financial losses and undermine public trust. Traditional rule-based systems often fail to detect sophisticated fraud patterns, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches.

### Key Issues Addressed

- **High False Positive Rates**: Traditional systems flag too many legitimate transactions
- **Evolving Fraud Patterns**: Fraudsters continuously adapt their methods
- **Class Imbalance**: Fraud cases represent only 3.75% of all transactions
- **Real-time Detection**: Need for immediate fraud assessment
- **Explainable AI**: Requirement for transparent decision-making

## üîç Research Questions & Goals

### Primary Research Questions

1. **How can we effectively identify fraudulent subsidy claims using machine learning?**
2. **What are the key behavioral and transactional patterns that indicate fraud?**
3. **How can we balance detection accuracy with false positive rates?**
4. **What features contribute most significantly to fraud prediction?**
5. **How can we provide explainable fraud risk assessments?**

### Project Goals

- ‚úÖ Develop a multi-layered fraud detection system
- ‚úÖ Implement real-time single transaction assessment
- ‚úÖ Create batch processing capabilities for large datasets
- ‚úÖ Provide explainable AI insights for fraud decisions
- ‚úÖ Achieve optimal balance between precision and recall
- ‚úÖ Build a user-friendly interface for fraud analysts

## üß† Core Concepts & Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Purpose**: Understanding data patterns and fraud characteristics

**Key Components**:

- **Data Distribution Analysis**: Examining feature distributions across fraud/non-fraud cases
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identifying relationships between variables
- **Temporal Patterns**: Understanding fraud trends over time
- **Geographic Analysis**: Regional fraud distribution patterns
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating derived features for better prediction

**Insights Gained**:

- Fraud cases show distinct patterns in transaction amounts
- Certain regions exhibit higher fraud rates
- Wallet activity status is a strong fraud indicator
- Income level correlates with fraud risk patterns

### 2. Clustering Analysis

**Purpose**: Unsupervised pattern discovery and customer segmentation

**Approach**:

- **K-Means Clustering**: Grouping similar transaction patterns
- **Feature Selection**: Using behavioral and transactional features
- **Cluster Profiling**: Analyzing fraud rates within each cluster
- **Anomaly Identification**: Detecting outlier clusters with high fraud rates

**Business Value**:

- Identifies natural customer segments
- Reveals hidden fraud patterns
- Supports targeted fraud prevention strategies
- Enables risk-based customer profiling

### 3. Anomaly Detection

**Purpose**: Identifying unusual patterns that deviate from normal behavior

**Methods Implemented**:

- **Statistical Outlier Detection**: Z-score and IQR-based methods
- **Isolation Forest**: Tree-based anomaly detection
- **One-Class SVM**: Support vector-based outlier detection
- **Local Outlier Factor (LOF)**: Density-based anomaly detection

**Role in Fraud Detection**:

- **First Line of Defense**: Flags unusual transactions for review
- **Feature Engineering**: Anomaly scores as input features
- **Complementary Approach**: Works alongside supervised methods
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Detects unknown fraud patterns

### 4. Supervised Fraud Prediction

**Purpose**: Learning from labeled fraud cases to predict future fraud

**Model Architecture**:

- **Random Forest**: Primary model (handles imbalanced data well)
- **Decision Tree**: Interpretable baseline model
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear relationship modeling
- **Ensemble Approach**: Combines multiple model predictions

**Feature Engineering**:

```python
# Key engineered features
Amount_per_Dependent = Transaction_Amount / (Household_Dependents + 1)
Energy_per_Dependent = Monthly_Energy_Consumption / (Household_Dependents + 1)
Wallet_Utilization = Transaction_Amount / Wallet_Balance
Transaction_Frequency = 1 / (Days_Since_Last_Transaction + 1)
```

## üìä Prediction Results & Interpretation

### Understanding Low Probability Percentages

**Why Fraud Probabilities Are Typically Low (<30%)**:

1. **Severe Class Imbalance**:

   - Non-fraud: 96.25% (77,028 cases)
   - Fraud: 3.75% (2,997 cases)
   - Models learn that fraud is statistically rare
2. **Conservative Model Behavior**:

   - Models prefer false negatives over false positives
   - Better to miss some fraud than flag legitimate transactions
   - Reflects real-world fraud detection requirements
3. **Proper Calibration**:

   - Low probabilities indicate well-calibrated models
   - Avoids overconfident predictions
   - Realistic assessment of fraud likelihood

### Risk Level Thresholds

```python
# Industry-standard thresholds for imbalanced fraud detection
if fraud_probability >= 0.70:    # HIGH RISK (‚â•70%)
    # Extremely suspicious - immediate investigation
    # Only 1-2% of transactions reach this level
  
elif fraud_probability >= 0.40:  # MEDIUM RISK (40-69%)
    # Requires manual review
    # Balanced threshold for operational efficiency
  
else:                            # LOW RISK (<40%)
    # Normal processing
    # Majority of legitimate transactions
```

### Contributing Factors Analysis

**High-Risk Indicators**:

- **Wallet Status**: Inactive/Suspended accounts
- **Transaction Patterns**: Unusual amounts for income level
- **Eligibility Mismatch**: Ineligible users claiming subsidies
- **Behavioral Anomalies**: Irregular transaction timing
- **Geographic Factors**: High-risk regions

**Feature Importance Ranking**:

1. Wallet Activity Status (25.3%)
2. Amount per Dependent (18.7%)
3. Days Since Last Transaction (15.2%)
4. Subsidy Eligibility Status (12.8%)
5. Transaction Channel (10.4%)

## üéØ Recommendations & Business Impact

### Immediate Actions

1. **High-Risk Transactions (‚â•70%)**:

   - Immediate manual review
   - Temporary hold on disbursement
   - Enhanced identity verification
2. **Medium-Risk Transactions (40-69%)**:

   - Automated secondary checks
   - Pattern analysis review
   - Conditional approval with monitoring
3. **Low-Risk Transactions (<40%)**:

   - Standard processing
   - Periodic sampling for quality assurance

### Strategic Improvements

**Model Enhancement**:

```python
# Implement class balancing for higher sensitivity
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    class_weight='balanced',  # Addresses class imbalance
    random_state=42
)
```

**Feature Engineering**:

- Incorporate temporal features (time-of-day, day-of-week)
- Add network analysis features (connected accounts)
- Include external data sources (credit scores, social media)

**Operational Integration**:

- Real-time API for transaction screening
- Automated case management system
- Feedback loop for model improvement
